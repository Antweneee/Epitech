## Heads Up

During my years at EPITECH, as most of the students here I started without much knowledge about programming, the first year was difficult to say the least add to that the pandemic of 2019 and the fact that we had to do a part of the year online so the first year was really difficult but I managed to pass it, after that the second year went alright but it was really during the end of the second year that I step up in my programming and finally the third year was a blast with amazing projects

## First Year

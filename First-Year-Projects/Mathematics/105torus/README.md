# 105 TORUS

> * __LANGUAGE: C__
> * The objective of this project is to solve a 4th degree equation: a4x^4 + a3x^3 + a2x^2 + a1x + a0 = 0. A direct resolution method does exist (Ferrari’s method), but does not generalize to higher degrees. Thus, we will rather compare 3 iterative algorithms:
> * The bisection method,
> * Newton’s method,
> * The secant method.
